	<h1>What is a Company Profile?</h1>
	<p>Simply put, your company profile is a professional introduction and aims to inform people (primarily prospective buyers and stakeholders) about your products, services, and current status, yes -- but that doesn't mean you should settle for something boring.<br/>

Below are 10 examples that will help you write and design a company profile that won't have your visitors immediately hitting the back button. <br/>

Note: Finding examples to share here wasn't easy. While this wasn't a great discovery for me while I was writing, it does show that a well-thoughtout company profile page is a great opportunity for your company to differentiate itself. So, take notes and get this free template to start planning yours!</p>
